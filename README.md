* [cite_start]**Key Metric:** Analyzed a total churn rate of **51.7%** across the customer base[cite: 843].
* **Tools Used:** Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Data Modeling.

## 🔍 Key Business Insights
* [cite_start]**Critical Loyalty Risk:** Identified a major retention gap in the **Platinum Loyalty Tier**, which exhibited the highest churn rate at **55.95%** compared to other groups[cite: 907].
* [cite_start]**Regional Performance:** **Leeds** emerged as the most engaged region with an Average Purchase Frequency of **4.3**, outperforming London (3.7)[cite: 858, 861].
